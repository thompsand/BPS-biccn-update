# BrainPalmSeq Update - BICCN 2.0

This series of files was used to update [BrainPalmSeq](https://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca), a curated database of RNA-seq studies for palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, with data from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) 2.0 data release available online at the [Allen Brain Cell Atlas](https://brain-map.org/bkp/explore/abc-atlas) and published as Yao, Z., van Velthoven, C.T.J., Kunst, M. et al. A high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types in the whole mouse brain. Nature 624, 317–332 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06812-z.

## Project Structure

[`ABC outputs/`](ABC%20outputs/) contains the counts pulled from the BICCN 2.0 data release as per [Allen Brain Cell Atlas gene expression data download instructions](https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/notebooks/10x_snRNASeq_tutorial_part_2a.html).
[`R`](R/) contains R scripts to add descriptors from the Allen Institute Common Cell Type Nomenclature as metadata in downstream visualizations and to prepare the data for processing in the Python notebooks.
[`csv`](csv/) contains text files generated by the R scripts. These are the input files for the Python notebooks.
[`Python Notebooks`](Python%20Notebooks/) contains Jupyter Notebooks meant to generate the Bokeh visualizations.
[`HTML outputs`](HTML%20outputs/) contains the outputs of the Jupyter Notebooks that were used to generate the visualizations on the website.

## Authors
- [@thompsand](https://github.com/thompsand) pulled data from Allen Brain Cell Atlas, generated R scripts, adapted Python Notebooks for analysis, and updated the website.
- [@Peter-Hogg](https://github.com/Peter-Hogg) wrote the templates for the Jupyter Notebook.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the Allen Institute for making this rich dataset publically available and the laboratory animals who made this dataset possible.
